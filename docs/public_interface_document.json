The application also integrates with Firebase for analytics tracking and supports localization and multiple flavors (development and production).",

It uses Stacked for state management, routing, and dependency injection. The main components include the App, AppView, and various feature-specific views and view models. The application also utilizes services for managing dialogs, bottom sheets, and navigation, as well as observing screen transitions for analytics purposes.",
